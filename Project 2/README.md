# Data Visualisation
# No√©mie Carrier

Here is my project for CART 263, DATA VISUALISATION
I will try to illustrate the complexity and richness of a community based(?) library of projects and information.
Ideally, the user will be able to navigate the different themes and subjects to find a project in particular. 

This will simply be a fun and interactive way to navigate the library, based on data from the projects submitted between 2005 and 2020.

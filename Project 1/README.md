# In the process of waking up
### on object oriented project
---
Each student will create a particle system using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Everyone
will be assigned a "personality" for their system, which should be embodied using movement,
colors, and behaviors of your particle system. Consider:
• Color and shape
Speed, movements, or easing
Number of particles and how they interact with each other
Interactions or behaviours of the system with the user or environment
Other creative elements like sounds, changes over time, or other ways of expression.
Be creative, look up particle systems and see whats possible, but don't feel limited by what most
particle systems look like. How can you re-imagine this code framework to make many small
parts that work together (or against each other)?

Alarm sounds 
ritual, long, negative?

Every morning, a quest for motivation?

Before waking up, everything is fuzzy and comfortable.
It's warm, safe, predictable, anybody could stay there for hours.

This morning is a bad morning, maybe asking myself about my source of motivation is actually... had on my motivation?

the anwser is to search for motivation by knowing yourself, by simply asking ourselves why we do things and 
The truth is, people are motivated by both. 

SUBCONCTIOUs in the code! the name of each motivation and their categories <3 
That's what I'm going for!!!

 >At the start, the design is completely black. Deep blue appears, revealing particles in the form of lines, "aurore boréale" like. They slowly move, ceating a relaxing 3d illusion flow. (see if I can integrate blurryness) as I move the mouse around, the colors vary, going red, orange then white (see color palette from pintewest). Some colors will last longer than others. 
At the end, by scrolling in the code, we learn that the colors shared by the mouse were variables named after cute engouragements and motivational quotes XD (lets see how cringe I want to get).
